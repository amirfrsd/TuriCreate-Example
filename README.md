# TuriCreate-Example
Generate CoreML Models by Analyzing and Training your dataset using Turi Create Python Package

# What is this?
This is a simple project with Python that you can easily generate CoreML Models with this project by only 2 steps<br/> 
## Procedure
1. Generate .SFrame file using generate_sframe() <br />
2. Train and Generate .MLModel file with train_sframe_and_generate_mlmodel <br />

## Note
1. TuriCreate uses Transfer Learning Technique for faster training, that you can read more about it [Here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/transfer-learning-for-deep-learning/).
2. Generated .MLModel can be used in iOS/MacOS Projects alongside CoreML.
3. [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) Dataset is included in this project.
